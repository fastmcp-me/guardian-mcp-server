## üìù **Implementation Notes**

All proposed features are designed to work within the Guardian API's current limitations while providing maximum value to users. Priority should be given to features that:

1. **Leverage existing API data** rather than requiring external services
2. **Provide immediate research value** for journalists and academics  
3. **Maintain the server's reliability** and error handling standards
4. **Scale well** with the Guardian's rate limiting constraints

This roadmap focuses on enhancing the core value proposition: making Guardian's rich archive more discoverable and useful for research, journalism, and content analysis.
